###Git workflow

**Getting the code**

- Fork this repo, do stuff, make pull request back here.

**Branch naming**

- Prefix your branches with type of update - feature|fix

**Commit messages**

Try to be as concise as possible while beeing informative. Describe 'why'
instead of 'how'. See links above for detailed info, but the rule of thumb is:

- Keep commits atomic
- Keep first line of commit messages below 65 characters. If you have more to
say, insert blank line and write your novel.

**Useful links:**

- [Atomic commit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_commit)


###Naming conventions

**Files:**

When naming files and directories, always use lowercase lettes and dash (-)
as delimiter.

*Correct:*

	file-name.ext

*Incorrect:*

	fileName.ext
	file_name.ext


###Coding style

**Indentation:**

Use spaces for indentation, never tabs. Configure your editor to use soft tabs
(or translate tabs to spaces, as labeled in some editors). Set it to 2 spaces
per tab.

**CSS naming convention**

Liberator uses BEM naming convention, as explained in: (http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/)
