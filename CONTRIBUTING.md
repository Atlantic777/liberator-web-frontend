###Git workflow

**Getting the code**

- Fork this repo, do stuff, make pull request back here.

**Branch naming**

- Prefix your branches with type of update - feature|fix

**Commit messages**

Try to be as concise as possible while beeing informative. Describe 'why'
instead of 'how'. See links above for detailed info, but the rule of thumb is:

- Keep commits atomic
- Keep first line of commit messages below 65 characters. If you have more to
say, insert blank line and write your novel.

**Useful links:**

- [Atomic commit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_commit)


###Naming conventions

**Files:**

When naming files and directories, always use lowercase lettes and dash (-)
as delimiter.

*Correct:*

	file-name.ext

*Incorrect:*

	fileName.ext
	file_name.ext


###Coding style

**Indentation:**

Use spaces for indentation, never tabs. Configure your editor to use soft tabs
(or translate tabs to spaces, as labeled in some editors). Set it to 2 spaces
per tab.

**CSS naming convention**

Liberator uses BEM naming convention, as explained at: http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/

**Inuitcss:**

Inuitcss is CSS framework by @csswizardry which is used to build Liberator
frontend. Read [the official getting started guide](https://github.com/inuitcss/getting-started)
for getting you onboard or, see [kitchen sink](http://csshugs.github.io/inuit-kitchen-sink/index.html)
for comperhensive list of components.

Inuitcss is built upon @csswizardry's ITCSS methodology, basics can be found at
[this youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OKZOV-iLj4).

*Note:*

There is an old repository for inuitcss which isn't being used anymore. All
references to inuitcss across liberator are considered for https://github.com/inuitcss.
