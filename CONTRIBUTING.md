###Git workflow

**Branch naming**

- TBD

**Commit messages**

Try to be as concise as possible while beeing informative. Describe 'what' instead of 'how'. See links above for detailed info, but the rule of thumb is:

- Keep commits atomic
- Keep first line of commit messages below 65 characters. If you have more to say, insert blank line and write your novel.

**Useful links:**

###Naming conventions

**Files:**

When naming files and directories, always use lowercase lettes and dash (-) as delimiter.

*Correct:*

	file-name.ext

*Incorrect:*
	
	fileName.ext
	file_name.ext


###Coding style

**Indentation:**

Use spaces for indentation, never tabs. Configure your editor to use soft tabs (or translate tabs to spaces, as labeled in some editors). Set it to 2 spaces per tab.
